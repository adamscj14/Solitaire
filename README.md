Solitaire Game

To play, simply run the "play_solitaire_commandline.py" script without any arguments.

Gameplay notes:
  * There definitely might still be a few bugs/kinks to work out
  
Future directions:
  * Adding graphics and point and click mechanics
  * Hosting game on python server to receive http commands
  * play_solitataire_gui.py is currently still a work in progress
