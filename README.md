Solitaire Game

To play, simply run the "Deal_cards.py" script without any arguments.

Gameplay notes:
  * Type "FLOP" in order to move the first card in the flop pile.
  * Destination indices should represent the card ON TOP OF WHICH you mean to play your card
  * There definitely might still be a few bugs/kinks to work out
  
Future directions:
  * Improved ease of inputting commands to simplify i.e replacing exact destinations with just the column number or replacing pile loci with a word, such as "PILE"
  * Adding graphics and point and click mechanics
  * Hosting game on python server to receive http commands
